## Question 4
After doing some research on triggers, I find that a trigger will not call itself recursively by default. That is, an update trigger does not call itself in response to a second update to the same table within the trigger.

And I suppose the data type of price is **float**.

If the trigger calls itself recursively, the results will be 3, 0.75, 0.75, respectively.
### a)
The price of pruchaseID #111 will be set to 3.
It will execute statements in the order of:
```sql
UPDATE Purchase
SET price = 1.5
WHERE purchaseID = 111

/* the original SQL statement */
UPDATE Purchase
SET price = 3
WHERE purchaseID = 111
```
### b)
The price of pruchaseID #111 will be set to 1.5.
It will execute statements in the order of:
```sql
/* the original SQL statement */
UPDATE Purchase
SET price = 3
WHERE purchaseID = 111

UPDATE Purchase
SET price = 1.5
WHERE purchaseID = 111
```
### c)
The price of pruchaseID #111 will be set to 1.5.
It will execute statements in the order of:
```sql
UPDATE Purchase
SET price = 1.5
WHERE purchaseID = 111
```
